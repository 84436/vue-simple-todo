# Simple Vue Todo App
This is a really simple todo app written in Vue.

Featuring:

-   [x] 100% "Vue Composition API"-free
-   [x] 100% TypeScript-free
-   [x] 100% "clean code"-free
-   [x] at least 99% bugs, free
-   [x] some lodash bits sprinkled in
-   [x] at least a `document.querySelector()` lurking somewhere in the code if you look hard enough maybe
-   [x] 0% aesthetic -- "Segoe UI" wth
-   [x] global.css -- hey you know `<style>` is a thing in Vue SFC right
-   [x] Bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) -- no seriously try it out, too damn fast; idk if it can be flexible with configs in the future tho
-   [x] two nice keyboard shortcuts: Enter to add, Esc to clear
-   [ ] suitable as a template to get started
